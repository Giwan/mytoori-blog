With so many click bait articles showing up on the web, I'm kind of getting sick of it. Here are some strategies for proper searching the web for true quality articles
To be honest I'm getting a bit frustrated with Google's search. Often I will type in a couple of words and it will choose to omit one of those words completely. This is relatively easy to fix but why do I need to fix it in the first place? (Btw, the fix is to surround the word you want with double quotes).

So to solve the issue, I thought to create a list of advanced searching techniques so that my search results can start to be more effective again.

## Google Advanced search

So first off I thought that [google advanced search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?visit_id=636791798507931051-3928064446&p=adv_operators&hl=en&rd=1) might be able to help me. As a developer I might be able to filter the results with a regular expression or something like that. No such luck. There are some useful search operators though.

### multiple site specific searches

Already knowing a few sites that often come up with good results you can search across these sites only to avoid the messy ones.

```google

online text editor site:medium.com OR site:stackoverflow.com
```

This will then only search those sites listed.

### searching related sites

Another beneficial search is for sites related to the given site.

```
related:medium.com
```
