To be honest I'm getting a bit frustrated with Google's search. Often I will type in a couple of words and it will choose to ommit one of those words completely. This is ofcourse relatively easy to fix but why do I need to fix it in the first place? (Btw, the fix is to surround the word you want with double quotes).

So to solve the issue, I thought to create a list of advanced searching techniques so that my search results can start to be more effective again.

## Google Advanced search

So first off I thought that [google advanced search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?visit_id=636791798507931051-3928064446&p=adv_operators&hl=en&rd=1) might be able to help me. As a developer I might be able to filter the results with a regular expression or something like that. No such luck. There are some useful search operators though.

### multiple site specific searches

Already knowing a few sites that often come up with good results you can search accross these sites only to avoid the messy ones.

```google

online text editor site:medium.com OR site:stackoverflow.com
```

This will then only search those sites listed.

### searching related sites

Another beneficial search is for sites related to the given site.

```
related:medium.com
```
