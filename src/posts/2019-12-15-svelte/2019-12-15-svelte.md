Svelte is a UI Framework, like ReactJS or ViewJS. However it takes a different approach by acting as a compiler. Unlike react and vue there is no framework code that that is shipped in production. Only the JavaScript written by the developer is running in production. Less JavaScript is sent to the browser.
This article shows how a small app, created in Svelte, can be embedded into this very post.

# Intro

Start a new Svelte app and install it.

```bash
# create a new Svelte app from template

npx degit sveltejs/template <entereyourappnamehere>
cd <entereyourappnamehere>
npm i
```

`npm run` shows the commands available.
`npm run dev` starts the project in develop mode showing a "Hello World" app on `http://localhost:5000`.

# The Svelte Template

The template consists of a src directory containing a `main.js` and `App.svelte`. This post will focus only on this template.

`main.js` is where the root app is created.

**Task**
Change the name property to bookTitle. Then set the value to "De Vliegende Hollander".
The app reloads but now says "Hello undefined". That's because name of the props no longer matches.

In `App.svelte` change `export let name` to `export let bookTitle`.
The title is now "Hello".
Below in `App.svelte` the `name` variable is still referenced. That should be changed to `bookTitle` too. In the same line, change "Hello" to "Book Title:".
It now shows "BOOK TITLE DE VLIEGENDE HOLLANDER".

## Styling

Styling is part of the component as it's effectively an HTML component. In `App.svelte` move "Book Title" into a `label`. Under the styling for the h1, add the style for the label:

```html
<style>
    h1 label {
        color: black;
        font-size: 0.5em;
    }
</style>
```

This applies separate styling for the label tag inside the H1 tag.

## image

Replace the `p` tag with an `image` tag to show the book cover.

```html
<img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mytoori/image/upload/c_scale,w_250/v1558464997/mytoori/covers/devliegendehollander.jpg"
/>
```

With just this code, there is a warning in the editor that the ALT tag is missing. It's important for accessibility so let's add it.

```html
<img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mytoori/image/upload/c_scale,w_250/v1558464997/mytoori/covers/devliegendehollander.jpg"
    alt="Ghost ship on high seas"
/>
```

# View Source

Viewing the source (OPTION + CMD + u) at this point shows that there is a bundle file. No special rendering framework is present.

There is one thing that needs to be fixed. In `main.js` we see that the app is rendered on `document.body`.

```javascript
import App from "./App.svelte";

const app = new App({
    target: document.body,
    props: {
        bookTitle: "De Vliegende Hollander",
    },
});

export default app;
```

Importing that now would replace our entire body. So let's fix that.

In `public/index.html` insert a div into the body and give it the id "root".

```html
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

In main.js replace `document.body` with `document.getElementById("root")`.

```javascript
import App from "./App.svelte";

const app = new App({
    target: document.getElementById("root"),
    props: {
        bookTitle: "De Vliegende Hollander",
    },
});

export default app;
```

The entire app renders on a div with the id "root".
