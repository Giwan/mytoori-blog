# Mytoori blog

## https://blog.mytoori.com

This project has been setup using Gatsby and stores the blog articles as local markdown files.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on https://zeit.co. To update the content, run the following from the projects root directory.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Creating a new post

The easiest way to get started with a new post is to copy one of the existing ones and modify the content. They are not very complicated either way.

# Todo

-   Filter out only published posts
-   Maybe switch to a CMS (NetlifyCMS or Wordpress)

## Articles

-   Static sites
-   Wordpress (ACF)
-   Typescript (jQuery?)
-   Typescript (demo)
-   WebAssembly
-   Svelte
-   CSS Grid
-   Flex box
